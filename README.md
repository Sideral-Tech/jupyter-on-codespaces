# Sideral Technologies - JupyterLab Devcontainer for GitHub Codespaces

**Sideral Technologies** proudly presents a meticulously crafted devcontainer configuration, tailored for the seamless execution of JupyterLab within GitHub Codespaces. This configuration ensures that our esteemed team members can effortlessly harness the power of JupyterLab, right within the GitHub environment.

## Packages & Configurations

For a detailed list of packages and configurations, team members are directed to inspect the `.devcontainer/environment.yml` file. This file contains the specifications for the Micromamba installations, ensuring a streamlined and efficient environment setup.

## How to Use

1. **Initialization**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository containing the devcontainer configuration.
   - Click on the green "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".

2. **Using JupyterLab with VSCode Extension**:
   - We recommend leveraging the integrated Jupyter extension within VSCode. This extension not only provides a seamless JupyterLab experience but also offers tools that significantly enhance code quality and boost production speed.
   - Once the Codespace is ready, you can directly create or open `.ipynb` notebooks. The Jupyter extension will automatically activate, offering an interactive notebook interface.
   - Utilize the rich set of tools provided by the extension, such as IntelliSense, debugging capabilities, and integrated Git, to supercharge your JupyterLab sessions.

3. **Running JupyterLab Directly**:
   - If you prefer the traditional JupyterLab experience, you can run it directly within the Codespace.
   - Open the integrated terminal and execute the command `jupyter lab`.
   - A link will appear in the terminal once JupyterLab is running. Click on it to access your JupyterLab instance.

4. **Customization**:
   - If additional packages or configurations are desired, modify the `.devcontainer/environment.yml` file. Restart the Codespace for changes to take effect.
